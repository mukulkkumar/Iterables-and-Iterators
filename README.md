# Iterables-and-Iterators

Iterable is an object, which one can iterate over. It generates an Iterator when passed to iter() method.

Iterator is an object, which is used to iterate over an iterable object using __next__() method. Iterators have __next__() method, which returns the next item of the object.

## *I have explained the concept of Iterables and Iterators which is divided into multiple parts*

###  *Part -1 -> Iterating Collections*

###  *Part -2 -> Iterators*

###  *Part -3 -> Iterators and Iterables*
